			Une biographie, genre t’es beau et intelligent, blablabla...
			One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed
			into a horrible vermin. He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see
			his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs,
			pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked.
			"What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream.

			Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake ! It all makes sense ! In a comic,
			you know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be ? He's the exact opposite of the hero.
			And most times they're friends, like you and me ! I should've known way back when... You know why,
			David ? Because of the kids. They called me Mr Glass.
